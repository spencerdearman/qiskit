# Creating entangled pair ----------------------------------------------------
"""
In order to make the entangled pair, I need to create a Bell pair. To create the
bell pair, I have to transfer one to the X-basis (|+‚ü© and |-‚ü©). In order to do 
so, I need to use a Hadamard gate.

Hadamard gate: A logic gate that turns a state of |0‚ü© or |1‚ü© to the 
superposition version of |0‚ü© or |1‚ü©. It converts the qubit from a custering 
state into a uniform superposed state. 

Qiskit uses a Hadamard gate as its basis. I also need to add a controlled not 
gate onto the other qubit controlled by the one in the X-basis.

CNOT Gate: A binary gate that is applied on two qubits that is the way used to
create an entangled pair.
